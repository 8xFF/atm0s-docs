# Core Primitives

##  Overview
Atm0s has a few core constructs: session, senders, receivers, and tracks. For the most basic,
a Session is the main object representing a connection to the media server, which will tie to a pair of roomId and peerId.
Senders and Receivers are the carriers of the tracks, they decide which track will be sent and received.
