# Connecting to Session

## Overview

A `Session` is the main construct in Atm0s. Session is tie to a pair of room and peer, which are identified by an unique string.

## Connect to a session

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="Javascript" default>
    ```js
    const session = createSession("gateway_url",{
      room: "my-room",
      peer: "my-peer",
      token: "some-token"
    });
    await session.connect();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React">
    ```jsx
    <SessionProvider
      gateways={["gateway_url"]}
      room="my-room"
      peer="my-peer"
      token="some-token"
    >
      ... streaming stuffs
    </SessionProvider>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

`createSession` takes three arguments:

- `room`: the room name, this should be unique for each session to identify the room for the user to join.
- `peer`: the peer id, this is also an unique string for each user to identify themselves in the room.
- `token`: is an access token each peer needs to connect to the room. This token is generated by the server and should be kept secret. You can read more about token [here](../server/token).
## Disconnect from a session

You should call `session.disconnect()` to disconnect from a session. This will also stop all the tracks and close the connection to the server.
