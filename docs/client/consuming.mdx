# Consume a stream

## Overview

While being connected to a session, a peer can subscribe to listen to any stream published to the session. The stream can be published by the peer itself or by another peer connected to the session.

## Listen for stream added events

To listen for stream added events, you need to register a listener for the `stream_added` event. The event handler receives a `StreamRemote` object as an argument.
The `StreamRemote` object contains the following properties:

- `kind`: The type of the stream. Can be `video` or `audio`.
- `peerId`: The peer ID of the peer who published the stream.
- `peerHash`: The peer hash of the peer who published the stream.
- `name`: The name of the stream. Which is the same as the name of which the peer who published the stream assigned.

Having the `StreamRemote` object, you can subscribe to the stream by creating a new `consumer`.
And view the stream by calling the `view` method on the `consumer` object.

```javascript
session.on("stream_added", (stream) => {
  const consumer = session.createConsumer(stream);
  const stream = consumer.view("key");
});
```

The view method takes a required argument `key` which is the key for the Session to keep track of. Mostly used for limiting the simulcast layers.

:::note

If you want to listen to your own stream, you can use the `mystream_added` event instead of the `stream_added` event.

:::

## Simulcast

If the stream is published with simulcast, you can specify which layers you want to view by passing the limit parameter to the view method.
The limit parameter is a `StreamLimit` object which contains the following properties:

- `priority`: The priority of the layer. Can be any positive integer. This is to specify which layer to view first.
- `maxSpatial`: The maximum spatial layer to view. Can be any positive integer.
- `maxTemporal`: The maximum temporal layer to view. Can be any positive integer.
- `minSpatial`: The minimum spatial layer to view (Optional).
- `minTemporal`: The minimum temporal layer to view (Optional).

```javascript
consumer.view("key", {
  priority: 50,
  maxSpatial: 2,
  maxTemporal: 2,
  minSpatial: 1,
  minTemporal: 1,
});
```

or use the `limit` method on the `consumer` object.

```javascript
consumer.limit({
  priority: 50,
  maxSpatial: 2,
  maxTemporal: 2,
  minSpatial: 1,
  minTemporal: 1,
});
```

## Consumer Events
You can subscribe to the following events on the `consumer` object by using the `on` method:

- `audio_level` - Fired when the audio level of the stream changes. The event handler receives a `number` as an argument.
- `state` - Fired when the state of the stream changes. The event handler receives a `string` as an argument. The possible values are `no_source`, `connecting`, `live`, `paused`, `key_only`, `source_deactivated`.
- `quality` - Fired when the quality of the stream changes. The event handler receives a `RemoteStreamQuality` object as an argument. The object contains the following properties:
  - `peer`: The peer ID of the peer who published the stream.
  - `name`: The name of the stream. Which is the same as the name of which the peer who published the stream assigned.
  - `kind`: The type of the stream. Can be `video` or `audio`.
  - `mos`: The mean opinion score of the stream.
  - `slot`: The slot of the stream.
